Project Overview
This project explores multiple Rock-Paper-Scissors bots employing diverse strategies, including:

Random choice

Conditional reaction

Markov chain models

Frequency analysis

The bots compete against each other in a round-robin tournament across many rounds. Throughout the matches, the evolving win, loss, and draw rates are recorded and analyzed to study how bot performance and strategy dynamics change over time.

Features
Implementation of various bot strategies

Automated round-robin matches between all bots

Detailed statistics tracking win/loss/draw rates

Analysis of strategic effectiveness over increasing rounds

Usage
Run the tournament simulation script to have all bots play against each other.

Collect match results and view detailed performance metrics.

Analyze the results to identify which strategies perform best and how outcomes evolve.

Future Work
Add more sophisticated bot strategies

Extend to multi-player versions

Visualize results with graphs and heatmaps
